docker push localhost:5000/school-committee:latest
kubectl apply -f k8s/external-secret.yaml -n statex-apps
kubectl apply -f k8s/configmap.yaml -n statex-apps
kubectl apply -f k8s/ -n statex-apps
kubectl rollout status deployment/school-committee -n statex-apps
```

## Post-deploy verification

- [ ] `curl https://school-committee.alfares.cz/api/health/ready` — 200 OK
- [ ] Check logs: `kubectl logs -n statex-apps -l app=school-committee --tail=50`
- [ ] No ERROR-level log lines on startup

## Rollback
